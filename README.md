### Python

 ```python
a = {"x": 1}
def fun(a):
    print(a["x"])
    a["x"] = 2
    print(a["x"])

fun(a)
print(a["x"])
```

```python
def csv_reader(file_name):
    for row in open(file_name, "r"):
        yield row
```

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(
            in_channels=1, 
            out_channels=10, 
            kernel_size=5)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        return x

model = Model()

output = model(torch.rand(1, 1, 28, 28))

```

### Theory

You are provided with an array of input values, denoted as $x$, and their corresponding output values $y$, which are based on the regression model:
$$y = a \cdot \sqrt{x} + b$$
Here, $a$ and $b$ are the model parameters that need to be estimated.

Could you please define an appropriate loss function for this model? Additionally, describe the process of using the gradient descent method to estimate $a$ and $b$.
